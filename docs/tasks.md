   - Create a centralized error handling mechanism
   - Implement consistent error responses for API endpoints
   - Add proper exception handling in utility functions

4. [x] Improve project modularity
   - Review dependencies between apps and reduce coupling
   - Create clear boundaries between different functional areas
   - Consider using Django signals for cross-cutting concerns

5. [ ] Enhance database query performance

    - Add factory classes for test data generation

14. [ ] Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline
    - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
    - Add code coverage reporting

## Documentation Improvements
